step by step 
Step 1: Preparing My Data

I open up my Excel (or Google Sheets) file, and the first thing I check is that my data is organized. I make sure that:

The columns have clear headers like Date, Sales, Region, Product, etc.
There are no blank rows or columns in between.
All the data is in a continuous range—just a clean, tidy table.
Once I’ve confirmed that, I’m ready to start creating the Pivot Table.

Step 2: Creating the Pivot Table

Select My Data Range
I click on any cell inside my data range and press Ctrl + A (on Excel) to select everything. It highlights the full data set, and I’m good to go.

Insert the Pivot Table
In Excel: I go to the Insert tab and click on PivotTable in the Tables group. A dialog box pops up, and Excel has already guessed the correct range for me. I choose New Worksheet to place my Pivot Table in a fresh sheet.
In Google Sheets: I head to the Data menu and click Pivot Table. A pop-up asks me where I want it, and I select New Sheet.
Step 3: Configuring the Pivot Table

Now the Pivot Table is here, and it’s time to arrange everything.

Drag Fields to Rows and Columns
I look at the PivotTable Field List (in Excel) or the sidebar in Google Sheets. I decide that I want to break the data down by Region, so I drag Region into the Rows section.

Next, I drag Sales into the Values section. Since I want to see the total sales by region, I leave it as a sum.

Add More Fields
I think it would be useful to also break it down by Product, so I drag Product into the Columns section. Now, I get a clear breakdown of sales by both region and product.

Filters (Optional)
I want to be able to filter by Date, so I drag Date into the Filters area. This way, I can easily view sales for a specific period.

Step 4: Formatting the Pivot Table

At this point, the data looks great, but I want to make it easier to read.

In Excel: I click anywhere inside the Pivot Table and go to the Design tab at the top. I choose a clean, professional style that’s easy on the eyes, like the “Light” style.
In Google Sheets: I use the toolbar to bold the headers and add borders around the Pivot Table. I adjust the fonts a little for clarity.
Step 5: Creating My Dashboard

Now comes the fun part: turning this data into a dashboard!

Add Pivot Charts
In Excel: I click on my Pivot Table, then head to the Insert tab and select a Column Chart. Excel generates a nice bar chart that visualizes the sales by region.

In Google Sheets: I click on the Pivot Table, go to Insert, and pick Chart. I choose a Bar Chart from the options, and the chart automatically updates based on the Pivot Table data.

More Charts for the Dashboard
I think it would be helpful to see how the products are performing, so I create another Pivot Table with Product in the rows and Sales in the values. I insert a Pie Chart to visualize the product sales distribution.

Arranging the Dashboard
Now I start positioning everything. I move the charts and tables around so they’re neatly aligned on the sheet. I want to make sure they’re spaced well enough so it’s easy to read and doesn’t feel cramped. Each chart gets a title like “Sales by Region” and “Product Sales Distribution” to keep things clear.

Step 6: Adding Interactivity to My Dashboard

I want to make the dashboard more interactive, so I can filter the data easily.

Add Filters
In Excel: I add a Slicer so I can filter the data by Year. I click anywhere in the Pivot Table, go to Insert, and choose Slicer. I select Year as the field to filter by. Now, I can just click on the slicer to filter the data by year, which is really handy.

In Google Sheets: I use Data Validation to create a drop-down list in a cell. This lets me filter by Region or Product directly from the dashboard.

Step 7: Polishing My Dashboard

With everything coming together, I start to polish the design.

In Excel: I hide the gridlines by going to View and unchecking Gridlines for a cleaner look.
I resize the charts to make them more balanced, and I adjust the column widths so everything fits neatly.
I make sure the titles are bold and adjust colors to differentiate the charts and tables, making it all visually appealing.
Step 8: Finalizing Everything
